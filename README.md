# Inheritance
A class to derive properties and characteristics from a parent class. The parent class is also known as the base class, while 
the derived class is known as the derived class or the child class.
The child class inherits all the properties of the parent class, including its data members and member functions.
This allows the child class to reuse code from the parent class, reducing code duplication and making the code easier to maintain.
